# Project #4. Feed Reader Testing

The Feed Reader Testing Project is the forth self-paced project in _Udacity Nanodegree Program_.

## Project Overview

In this project there is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developers of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and left the application with an incomplete test suite.

The goal of the project is to complete the test suite.

## Application Launch
To start the application and see how it passes the tests open file `index.html` in a browser.

In order to open the `index.html` file you have two methods to copy it locally:
- either download the zip file
- or clone the repository.

## Test Suite Exploration
To gain an understanding of how the test suite itself works explore the Jasmine spec file `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.
